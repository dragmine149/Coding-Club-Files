# Coding Club Files

A folder of files, might be random to some but useful to others.

Latest [file](ImagesInTK.py)

## Notes

- Fell free to share this with anyone, all the files should be dated with date created.
- Run.py is required in some files.
- I will not be accepting new additions to this repo. This repo will eventually become an archive of files

## File Information

TBA
<!-- okay, if you read this then hi.
Basically this area is a list of the files and some information about them other than using the git stuff
Although this is going to take a while due to other things and automating it is not always fun. -->
