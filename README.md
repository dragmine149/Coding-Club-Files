# Coding Club Files
A folder of files, might be random to some but useful to others, let me give you the backstory.

## Backstory
Whilst i was at school, i attended a club called 'Coding Club' (Other information is private for privacy reasons). And to help my fellow club mates out, i uploaded all the files to google drive.
I decided to move over to github though to make the files easier to read as drive shows them as plain text. So here are the files.

# Notes
- Fell free to share this with anyone, all the files should be dated with date created.
- Run.py is required in some files.
- I will not be accepting new additions to this repo. This repo will eventually become an archive of files
